# Hip Fracture Prediction Project

## Overview
This project utilizes a RandomForestClassifier model to predict the likelihood of hip fractures based on various factors, including bone mineral density, demographic data, and other health indicators. The goal is to assist healthcare professionals in identifying individuals at high risk of hip fractures early, enabling preventative measures to mitigate these risks.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises multiple features crucial for assessing the risk of hip fractures, such as bone health indicators, demographic details (age, sex), and additional health-related metrics. Preprocessing steps include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature selection to optimize the dataset for model training and evaluation.

## Model Training and Evaluation
We employ a RandomForestClassifier, with hyperparameters fine-tuned through GridSearchCV, ensuring robust model training. The model's performance is evaluated against key metrics: accuracy, sensitivity (recall), specificity, precision, and F1 Score, demonstrating its effectiveness in hip fracture prediction.

## Key Findings
The RandomForestClassifier showed excellent performance across all metrics, validating its reliability in predicting hip fractures. This model's application can significantly contribute to healthcare by facilitating the early identification of high-risk individuals, thereby enabling timely preventative interventions.
